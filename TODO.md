### TODO LIST  ###

- [x] add protection level to caches
- [x] middleware for cache
- use caches more often
- view component hierarchy in a better way
- diffing (I know, huge one :P)
- 'this' for components
- refs (like in react js) ('this')
- child elements ('this')
- attributes ('this')
- event system
- routing (client and server with one API)
- DB interaction / ajax interaction (1 exit point for DB and ajax would be really nice)
- error handling
- syntax checking
- production / development modes
- server side stuff:
  - general structure
  - incoming requests / responses
  - hook-in to client-side routing (shared code)
  - sending render relevant data to the client
